__Data__

The directories in this repository contain the following data:
1. __00 Image Examples:__ contains example images from different experiments.
2. __01 Time Series Data:__ contains time series of floc size distribution statistics (by volume), such as D50, moving towards an equilibrium value through net growth or net breakup.
3. __02 Equilibrium Data:__ contains floc size statistics once the distribution has reached a steady state condition.
4. __03 Settling Velocity Data:__ contains the average measured settling velocity of all flocs that fall within a 10 micron  wide floc size bin paired to the floc size associated with the bin centers. (The first bin is from zero to 15 micron)

Each folder also contains the pertinent metadata for the associated files in that directory.
